When a conditional permanent resident’s status is within 90 days of expiration, the conditional permanent resident is ineligible for a replacement conditional resident card and must file a petition to remove the conditions, as follows:\\n1. If you became a conditional permanent resident through marriage to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, and your two-year conditional permanent resident status is expiring within the next 90 days, file Form I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence; or\\n2. If you became a conditional permanent resident based on the creation of a new commercial enterprise and a financial investment in the United States, and your conditional permanent resident status is expiring within the next 90 days, file Form I-829, Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions.\\nUpon receipt of your properly filed Forms I-751 or I-829, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shall extend your conditional permanent resident status automatically, if necessary, until such time as USCIS has adjudicated the petition.
